- Install the required libraries:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```

- Ensure RStudio is installed for optimal R Markdown execution.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure all necessary R packages are installed.
3. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
4. Run the entire document to generate the final report.

## Project Structure Overview

- **`Iordache_Andreea_final_project-1.Rmd`**
  - The primary R Markdown document that includes data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation.
  
- **Data Files (if applicable)**
  - Any dataset required for the analysis should be placed in the appropriate directory and loaded within the `.Rmd` script.

## Usage Instructions

- Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
- Click on `Knit` to generate the final output in the desired format (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.).
- Review the generated report for insights and results.

## Output Description

- **Generated Report:** A well-structured document containing:
  - Data cleaning and processing steps
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Statistical summaries and key findings
  - Data visualizations
  - Conclusion and potential recommendations

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### 1. Issue: Missing Libraries
  - Ensure all required libraries are installed using:

    ```r
    install.packages("missing_package_name")
    ```

### 2. Issue: Dataset Not Found
  - Verify the dataset is placed in the correct directory and properly referenced in the `.Rmd` file.

### 3. Issue: Output Not Generating
  - Check for syntax errors and missing dependencies in the script.
  - Restart RStudio and try running the document again.

This project provides a structured analysis using R Markdown and can be extended with additional data sources and advanced statistical techniques.
